# rust-twitch-queue-bot
Twitch bot for organising queues - developed live at twitch.tv/stuck_overflow

Use `cargo_run` to run it. Current implementation simply connects anonymously to the "stuck_overflow" Twitch channel chat and prints something on local terminal when certain commands are issued in the chat.
